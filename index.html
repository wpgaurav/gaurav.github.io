<p>I am a blogger, Front End Developer &amp; Designer and an experienced Graphic Artist. I live in New Delhi, India and work as graphic designer for Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare, Government of India. I have lived and excelled my life as a freelance artist &amp; content writer for more than 8 years. I am one of the earliest bloggers from the country. I am 25 years old no-fun guy who thinks a lot, speaks a lot and does a lot. I aspire to become a good social servant someday. I am a high quality thinker and <em>thinking</em> is one of my favorite hobbies. Additionally, I enjoy my free-time in light gaming &amp; reading and writing. I develop and change habits regularly â€“ to make me feel diverse.</p>
